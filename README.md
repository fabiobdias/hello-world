# about me
I'm a 30 years old oceanographer, in the middle of my phd road. I started using github as a way to keep a backup of all tools package I've created to run and analyse the ocean-sea ice models. My main interest are:

1) Numerical models:
- Modullar Ocean Model (MOM)
- Sea-ice Simulator (SIS)
- Los Alamos Sea-ice model (CICE)

2) Post-processing tools:
- ferret
- python

3) Type of analyses:
- Common diagnostics figures:
  - global (volume-integrated) temperature/salinity;
  - horizontally-integrated T/S;
  - zonally-integrated T/S;
  - SST/SSS bias relative to WOA;
  - transports: AMOC, SMOC, GMOC;
  - sea-ice extension;
  - SST globally-integrated
- Ocean heat budget:
  - Global-integrated;
  - Maps depth-integrated;
  - Zonally-integrated
